# Java-OOP-Foundations
This repository contains foundational projects developed during my first five weeks as a Software Engineering (Honors) student at UT Arlington. These exercises focus on Java syntax, control flow, and basic data structures.

## Projects

### Pothole Driving
A console game using a 10x10 2D array. 
* Features coordinate-based movement and boundary validation.
* Uses randomized "pothole" placement to manage hidden game states.

### Rock, Paper, Scissors
A standard game implementation against a randomized computer opponent.
* Demonstrates `switch-case` logic and `do-while` loops for replayability.
* Includes round-based scoring and final result calculation.

### Binary-to-Decimal Converter
An algorithmic tool to convert 4-bit binary strings into decimal integers.
* Implemented using mathematical logic with the modulus operator and `Math.pow`.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Java Fundamentals:** Scanner input, Loops, and Conditionals.
* **Data Handling:** 2D Array (Matrix) manipulation.
* **Robustness:** Basic input validation using `hasNextInt()`.
